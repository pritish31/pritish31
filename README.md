# Hi! I'm Pritish 👋😄
Pronouns: He/Him.  

### Data Scientist | Data Enthusiast 💻

🔭 I recently worked on resolving employee record inconsistencies for JerseySTEM using AppSheet, SQL, and Looker, which resulted in an 11% reduction in inefficiencies.

🌱 I graduated in January 2024 with a Master of Science in **Data Science** from the University at Buffalo.

👯 I'm open to collaborating on projects involving data analysis, building machine learning pipelines, or any innovative software solutions.  

💬 Ask me about anything related to **Python, R, SQL, PostgreSQL, Power BI, Tableau**, AppSheet, Data Science, **Machine Learning, LLMs and GenAI**.

📫 How to reach me: pritishkamble7@gmail.com | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pritish-kamble)  

⚡ Fun fact: I was the captain of my university cricket team and love combining strategy on the field with data-driven decision-making.

### 📚 Research
I have extensive research experience in electromagnetic engineering, specifically in broadband microstrip antennas, with 11 research papers published in reputed journals and conferences such as IEEE, Springer, and Science Direct. Highlights of my work include:

💡 Pioneering a novel 120° Sectoral Micrsostrip Antenna design that doubled bandwidth compared to traditional CMSA designs.

💡 Engineering gap-coupled variations of sectoral microstrip antenna to achieve bandwidth of up to 1,000 MHz with enhanced gain.

💡 Co-authored 11 research papers, including "Multi-Resonator Variations of 120° Sectoral Microstrip Antennas for Wider Bandwidth" (Springer) and "Gap-Coupled Variations of 120° Sectoral Shape Microstrip Antennas for Wideband Response" (IEEE Xplore).
